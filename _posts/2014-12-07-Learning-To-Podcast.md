Recorded around a single microphone for their first attempt at an episode, we learn a little bit about The Ducks and experience the first installment of 'Back of the Napkin' where we find out how many balloons it would take to float a turtle. The Ducks invite you to enjoy the attempt, and promise to find a way to lower the volume of Matt G's voice in future episodes.
