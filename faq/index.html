        <h3>What's Rubber Ducking?</h3>
        The term originated in the book "The Pragmatic Programmer" and
        refers to a debugging practice where an engineer describes their attempted solution
        out-loud to an inanimate object in an effort to trigger the a-ha moment that will
        solve the problem.
